                      According to Erikson, development involves a series of stages where youth must resolve various crises that arise to develop primary virtues for that stage. The way conflicts are solved determines the personal identities of the person and their future development. Identity development is a crucial process in adolescents that helps them develop unique personalities and connections with others. Some of the major changes that occur during adolescence include the development of new attachments.  Developments of attachments are inclined towards peers in young adults as compared to children who are attached to their parents. The identity stage occurs between the ages of 12 and 18.

                         One piece of adolescent identity is the search for unique identities known as identity diffusion. The big question that adolescents ask themselves is "Who am I?" As a result, they do experience role confusion as they are trying to choose between identities. The young adult often does not have concrete commitments to the question and therefore does not make an effort toward understanding it. The other piece of adolescent identity known as foreclosure is characterized by the young adult having less engagement with identity experimentation as they have already established a list of identities they may be interested in. Moratorium is characterized by the individual having several choices but they are still not committed to any. The Identity-achievement status marks the end of selecting identities as the individual has attained a coherent identity based on personal decisions.
